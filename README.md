# üöÄ Team4-CosmBlockchain

This project is an **end-to-end AML monitoring system** for blockchain transactions. From the time a transaction is initiated on-chain, the system:

1. Receives a transfer request from a smart contract.
2. Performs automated AML checks via the Oracle and AML server (including sanctions list checks, heuristic analyses, and ML-based risk scoring).
3. Stores transaction and wallet information in a database.
4. Allows humans to analyze wallet and subgraph data using interactive graph visualizations and MCP tools to detect potential high-risk or suspicious activity.

This ensures continuous monitoring and supports both automated and human-led compliance workflows.

This README.md is a high level overview of the system. If you require more details, find them in architecture/arch/solution.pptx
The project is based on [wfblockchain/wfHackathon](https://github.com/wfblockchain/wfHackathon), but extended with AML checks, an oracle service, a data-helper scheduler system, graph visualization tools, and MCP integration.

## üìÇ Database Setup

All AML-related tables are written to the **`aml_data`** database.

### 1. Start PostgreSQL in Docker (modified for local host access)

```powershell
docker run -d --name postgres_new `
  -v ${PWD}\data:/var/lib/postgresql/data `
  -v ${PWD}\db-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d `
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres `
  -e POSTGRES_DB=new_aml_db `
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password `
  -p 5433:5432 postgres:15
```

### 2. Load schema

```powershell
docker cp data-helper\sql-scripts\create_flagged_wallets_table.sql postgres_new:/create_flagged_wallets_table.sql

docker exec -i postgres_new psql -U postgres -d aml_db -f /create_flagged_wallets_table.sql
```

‚úÖ The **SDN/OFAC list** is automatically fetched and refreshed by scheduled scripts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask fastmcp psycopg2 networkx pyvis apscheduler
```

---

## üîó Oracle Service

The oracle service listens for events on-chain (e.g., AML check requests) and responds back with a risk decision.

Start the oracle service:

```powershell
cd code\oracle-service
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

---

## üß™ AML Check Server

The AML check server handles direct AML verification requests via REST API.

Start the AML check server:

```powershell
python code\oracle-service\aml_check.py
```

This will launch a server on `http://127.0.0.1:6000/aml-check` where AML verification requests can be sent.

---

## üïí Scheduler Service

We use **APScheduler** to run periodic heuristic and sanctions checks. The scheduler can be started manually:

```powershell
python code\data-helper\python-scripts\scheduler.py
```

### Scheduled Tasks

| Script                  | Purpose                          | Frequency      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `Mixer_check.py`        | Detect potential mixing activity | Every 6 hours  |
| `Peeling_chains.py`     | Track peeling chain transactions | Every 6 hours  |
| `Structuring_check.py`  | Detect structuring patterns      | Every 6 hours  |
| `OFACSanctionScript.py` | Update OFAC sanctions list       | Every 24 hours |
| `third_party_data.py`   | Ingest external data sources     | Every 12 hours |

The scheduler ensures the AML system is continuously updated with the latest heuristics and sanctions data.

## üìä Graph Visualization

To visualize the wallet transaction graph, run:

```powershell
python code\wallet-Graph\graph_builder.py
```

This generates an interactive graph where:

* **Nodes** represent wallets. Node color indicates risk: purple = root wallet, red = high risk, blue = low risk.
* **Edges** represent transactions, with attributes such as amount and timestamp.
* Neighborhood subgraphs can be generated to explore wallet connections up to N hops.

![Graph Structure](https://github.com/dev6576/Team4-CosmBlockchain/blob/main/architecture/arch/Graph.png)

The full transaction graph is stored in `wallet_graph.pkl` and can be used by the MCP server to generate subgraphs on demand.

---

## üß† ML Layer

The AML system uses a **Graph Neural Network (GNN) / DNN** for risk classification.

### Features Extracted per Wallet Node

* Transaction frequency and amounts
* Counterparty diversity
* In-degree and out-degree
* Graph centrality measures (betweenness, closeness)
* Clustering coefficient
* Historical risk score aggregation

### Model Workflow
![Architecture](https://github.com/dev6576/Team4-CosmBlockchain/blob/main/architecture/arch/Architecture.png)
1. Load transaction graph from database.
2. Extract node features and construct adjacency matrix.
3. Train GNN/DNN on labeled historical data.
4. Evaluate and classify wallets as **low, medium, or high risk**.
5. Store predictions in database for the AML oracle to use in decision-making.


### Transaction Flow

![Transaction Flow](https://github.com/dev6576/Team4-CosmBlockchain/blob/main/architecture/arch/TransactionFlow.png)

This flow shows how a transfer request triggers an AML check, how the oracle queries the ML model and sanctions lists, and how the response is written back on-chain.

## üß™ Smart Contract Testing (CosmWasm)

### Request Transfer

```json
{
  "RequestTransfer": {
    "recipient": "wasm1ga4d4tsxrk6na6ehttwvdfmn2ejy4gwfxpt2m7",
    "amount": {
      "denom": "ustake",
      "amount": "1000"
    }
  }
}
```

### Oracle Response

  "OracleResponse": {
    "request_id": 3,
    "approved": true,
    "flagged": false,
    "reason": "",
    "risk_score": 0
  }
}
```

## üõ† MCP Integration

The AML Wallet Graph MCP server exposes tools that can be used from ChatGPT/Claude or any MCP-compatible client.

### Setup & Start MCP

1. Ensure `wallet_graph.pkl` from `code\wallet-Graph` is copied into the MCP folder (`code\mcp-layer`) **before starting**.
2. Start the MCP server (Claude config example):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AML-Wallet-Graph-MCP": {
      "command": "D:\\GitHub\\Team4-CosmBlockchain\\code\\oracle-service\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "uv",
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "D:\\GitHub\\Team4-CosmBlockchain\\code\\mcp-layer\\aml_mcp.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

1. **`db_schema()`** ‚Üí Returns the database schema (tables and columns).
2. **`db_query(sql: str)`** ‚Üí Run any SQL query on the AML database; returns results as JSON.
3. **`build_wallet_graph(wallet_id: str, max_hops: int = 2, output_file: str = "wallet_subgraph.html")`** ‚Üí Extracts a subgraph for a wallet and generates an interactive HTML visualization.

You can test MCP tools from ChatGPT or Claude once the server is running by invoking queries like `db_schema()` or `build_wallet_graph(wallet_id='wasm1...')`.
